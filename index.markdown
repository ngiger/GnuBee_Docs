This project is **NOT** endorsed in any way by the Free Software Foundation [FSF](http://www.fsf.org). But the project is heavily influenced by the philosophy of Free Software.

We received on October, 2 2017 an email from the FSF requesting to not use the name GnuBee. As soon as a new name is determined we will update this site. The e-mail contains the sentence with *Thank you so much for working to make freedom-respecting hardware*


Introduction {#introduction}
----------

The GnuBee Personal Cloud One and Two (GB-PC1, GB-PC2) are network-attached storage (NAS) devices specifically engineered to run free, libre, open source software (FLOSS). The GB-PC has all the functionality of any commercial, proprietary NAS, but at a much lower cost and with the transparency, reliability, and accessibility advantages that come with using FLOSS.

- Neil Brown [wrote about](https://lwn.net/Articles/743609/) the GnuBee for [LWN](https://lwn.net) with a focus on mainline kernel support.

- Ben Sturmfels [blogged about](https://stumbles.id.au/getting-started-with-the-gnubee-personal-cloud-2-or-1.html) his experiences with the GnuBee-PC2.

Free as in Freedom {#free}
----------------------------

We designed the GnuBee Personal Cloud with the Free Software Foundation’s Respects Your Freedom (RYF) certification in mind and have already initiated the application process with FSF.

The GnuBee Personal Cloud can run several popular FLOSS suites for managing routers, NAS devices, or just general computing. These are some of the main suites the GB-PC1 can run:

## Debian

## OpenMediaVault

The OpenMediaVault project is a Debian-based network-attached storage solution designed for home and small office user who lack deep technical experience or knowledge of setting up and and administering an NAS.

## libreCMC

Billed as “the libre embedded GNU/Linux distro,” libreCMC is a fork of the LEDE-project stable branch that uses only libre components.

## LEDE-project

The Linux Embedded Development Environment (LEDE) project is a reboot of the OpenWrt community.
The GnuBee Personal Cloud One is supported by the LEDE-project in trunk.

# FLOSS Devices at Reasonable Prices

GnuBee started with a simple idea: instead of hacking commodity hardware, let’s build the toys we want to play with from scratch . We want to show the world what devices running free software can do. The Personal Cloud 1 is our first product, though we have others in the works. If the GB-PC1 is successful, there will be plenty of others to follow!

If you want to buy it, please email "L. D. Pinney" <ldpinney@gmail.com>.

How do we keep the cost of our devices down? Because we have both Chinese (Xiaoping) and US (Larry) roots, we have some major advantages over other teams. We don’t need to rent expensive living and work space in China (we stay with family!), and we don’t need to hire translators and other go-betweens. We can work directly with vendors and manufacturers. Because we are committed to working only with FLOSS projects, our software development costs are also reduced and distributed.
