## Documentation

It should not be hard to spot errors or missing items in our documentation. If you know how to fill them, please let us know.

## Art work

We would be happy to have some nice artwork to add to our home page or design ideas for future products.

## SW

There a lot of projects which are useful for the the GnuBee Personal Cloud. Therefore just try to ensure that the SW you use/like/need most, runs fine on the GnuBee, too.

Ideas/Contributions via new useful programs are surely also welcome.
